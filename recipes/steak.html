    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple but delicious steak. Seared and crispy on the outside, rare and juicy on the inside. Only requires butter, salt, pepper, and fresh garlic.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh cut of steak with decent marbling</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Fresh Garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn heat on high and allow cast iron to soak up heat as evenly as possible, occasionally shifting pan slightly</li>
        While cast iron is heating:
        <li>Grab steak, sprinkle coarse sea salt or himalayan rock salt, and freshly ground pepper to taste on one side </li>
        <li>Repeat on other side</li>
        <li>Once pan is heated, add butter and turn heat to low-med. Add coarsely crushed garlic</li>
        <li>Once air above butter is "wavering", before butter smokes, add steak to cast iron</li>
        <li>There should be a healthy sizzle, but not too agressive, and it will calm down as the steak absorbs heat :-)</li>
        <li>If garlic in danger of burning, scoop it on top of the steak to let its flavor soak down into the steak</li>
        <li>After 1-3 minutes, steak should develop a nice crust and separate from pan effortlessly. Flip steak to other side</li>
        <li>Cook this side 2-4 minutes, waiting for equivalent crust</li>
        <li>With tongs, flip steak on narrow side and sear each side for ~1 minute each</li>
        <li>Interior at this point is probably in rare to medium-rare territory</li>
        <li>If desired, cover pan and set to low till steak reaches desired internal temp</li>
        <li>Remove steak and let rest on a plate a few minutes before serving</li>
    </ol>
